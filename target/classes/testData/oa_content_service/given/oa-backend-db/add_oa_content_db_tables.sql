CREATE TABLE OA_CONTENT.RELATION
(
    RELATION_ID bigserial NOT NULL,    -- Internal Id of the RELATION table. Used as PK.
    OBJECT_ID_1 bigint NOT NULL,    -- Reference to the OBJECT_ID of the first object of the relationship. In RDF notation it stands for the subject in the (subject - predicate - object) triple.
    RELATION_TYPE_ID bigint NOT NULL,    -- Id of the relation type between the two referenced objects. This Id references a row in the RELATION_TYPE table.  In RDF notation the relation type stands for the predicate in the (subject - predicate - object) triple. Possible values for RELATION_TYPE_ID reference relation types names like: - "is-valid-for" - "references" - "is-child-of", - ... Only certain combinations of the types of the two objects and the relation type make sense.
    OBJECT_ID_2 bigint NOT NULL,    -- Reference to the OBJECT_ID of the second object of the relationship. In RDF notation it stands for the object in the (subject - predicate - object) triple.
    OBJECT_ID_CONTEXT bigint NOT NULL   DEFAULT -1,    -- Optional third OBJECT_ID, which references a row from the OBJECT table to provide a context for the relation between object 1 and object 2. For most relations this column will be set to a dummy object (-1) to avoid conflicts with NULL values in the extended unique constraint.  For relations of type 'has-next-sibling', which express the order of sub menu items or topics in the menu hierarchy, the OBJECT_ID_CONTEXT has to be the parent object_id, because the order is only unique in the context of the parent menu item, if the same sub menu item or topic can appear at different places in the menu structure. For 'has-next-sibling' relations on the top level of the menu hierarchy the OBJECT_ID_CONTEXT is -1, as main menu items (=function-lists) are the roots of the menu trees and don't have a parent. For 'has-next-sibling' relations on all other levels of the menu hierarchy the OBJECT_ID_CONTEXT has to be populated with the object_id of the parent object (from the 'is-child-of' relation).
    VALID_FROM timestamp(6) with time zone NOT NULL,    -- Point of time, from when this relationship is valid.  If the source system does not provide the start timestamp of the validity period, the application has to set this field to the current timestamp when inserting the row into the database.
    VALID_TO timestamp(6) with time zone NOT NULL,    -- Point of time, until this relationship is valid.   When inserting the row into the DB, this field is usually set to '9999-12-31' to indicate that it is valid infinitely, if the source system does not provide the timestamp for the end of the validity period. When updating an object to make it invalid, the VALID_TO field has to be set to a definite point in time.
    CREATION_TIMESTAMP timestamp(6) with time zone NOT NULL,    -- Point in time (date and time), when the row was inserted into the database.
    MODIFICATION_TIMESTAMP timestamp(6) with time zone NULL    -- Point in time (date and time), when the row was updated. Is initially set to NULL, when inserting a row.

    OBJECT_ID_FROM_SOURCE varchar(1024) NOT NULL,    -- Unique Identifier of this object in the source system.  For objects with payload from ARKI4 (topics, menu items, etc.) this value is composed from the y.io.id and an N-Tuple-Hash value, which is created from the concatenated validities of the object: <y.io.id>-<N-Tuple-MD5-Hash>.  For creating the N-Tuple-Hash at first the normalized validities of the object are concatenated like this:    '<VEHICLE_LINE><STATE_OF_CONSTRUCTION><MARKET><TARGET_DEVICE><INFO_PRODUCT>'. In detail: '<business_line><vehicle_line_lead><vehicle_line_variant><vehicle_line_market><state_of_construction><market><device><model><model_variant><device_market><ip_name>'. Example: 'p2231ma-ece/row808+059ece/rowntg7.0premiumhu-ece/rowip_diba'.   The MD5-Hash for this example string is 'c8cd3f15edb4435c109e4990ca2d3987'. The resulting OBJECT_ID_FROM_SOURCE for y.io.id = '3afdb18ebd300ec3ac190d2b02b3e08f' would then look like this:     '3afdb18ebd300ec3ac190d2b02b3e08f-c8cd3f15edb4435c109e4990ca2d3987'.  For masterdata objects, which are created internally inside the OA System, this field contains the last part of the URI for that object in lower case letters. The complete URI looks like that: <OA_URI_SCHEME>:<OA_URI_AUTHORITY>:<object_type_name>:<object_id_from_source>. The values for OA_URI_SCHEME and OA_URI_AUTHORITY are parameters in the SYS_PARAM table. Object_type_name is from the OBJECT_TYPE table.  Example values for object_id from source for masterdata objects: - Vehicle-Line: "177:0:ma-ece/row:2018.04e:p", - State-of-Construction: "808+059", - Information Product: "ip_diba",  - Target Device: "ntg:6.0:entry:hu-ece/row", - Market: "ece/row".

    OBJECT_NAME_FROM_SOURCE varchar(100) NULL    -- Optional name of the object from the source system. It is only available for some object types. E.g. for object type 'cb_answer' (chatbot answer) the value for this field is retrieved from: //answer.ref/@y.io.name.

    MODEL_VARIANT varchar(50) NULL,    -- Model variant of the target device in lower case letters. This determines the hardware equipment.  Examples: For device "ntg"  and model "6.0" possible value for MODEL_VARIANT could be "entry540", "entry720", "mid540", "mid720" and "high". For device "iphone" and  MODEL "8" a possible value for MODEL_VARIANT could be "plus". This column may not have a value for all target devices.
    DEVICE_MARKET varchar(50) NULL,    -- Market for the target device in lower case letters. This column may be empty for some target devices. In case of a "ntg" model for the DiBA on a vehicle this attribute contains the HU-Market, e.g. "hu-ece/row".

    MIME_TYPE varchar(255) NOT NULL    -- The MIME type specifies the data format of the object's payload. It also determines in which special data table the actual data is stored.  Currently used mime types are: - 'text/xml' for objects with a payload in table XML_DATA (like topics, menu items, ...), - 'image' for objects with a payload in table MEDIA_REF_DATA .    Examples for possible other MIME types would be: - 'text/plain'  - 'image/png'  - 'image/jpeg' - 'video/mp4'  - 'text/xml' - 'application/pdf' - application/json'  TODO: (to be clarified for future use):  - If we don't store the image or video itself, but only a reference, the MIME type maybe would not be 'image/...' or 'video/...'.  Should we really use a mime type prefix like 'image' or maybe 'text/plain', 'text/url' or no mime type at all?  - If we would store a PDF document as a base64 encoded text, the MIME type would not be 'application/pdf' but 'application/base64' and we would store it in a column with data type TEXT? Or would the MIME type be text/plain ?  - Will we need a kind of mapping of (OBJECT.type, OBJECT_PAYLOAD.mime_type) to the name of the data table, where we stored the actual data, maybe not in the database, but somewhere?  - Maybe we will later split this field into two fields for mediatype ('image', 'application', ...) and subtype ('jpeg', 'png', 'text'...), because we sometimes only use the mediatype.
